# The Ground Gives Way 2.6 Repack by strategineer

## Intro

TGGW is one of the best roguelikes out there. Setting it up and making it look good can be a little tough though.

So I've pre-configured a portable version of Cmder with sane defaults to make playing TGGW as pain free as possible.

I recommend using the ProggySmall.ttf font that I've included in this pack because it looks good but feel free to use any font you want (Windows Key + Alt + P will bring up the Cmder options). You might need to play around with the font size if you change the font though.

## Instructions

1. Install ProggySmall.ttf font
2. Run the TGGW.cmd file.
3. Enjoy!

## Licenses

Both Cmder and the Proggy font are licensed using the MIT license.
