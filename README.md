# The Ground Gives Way 2.6 Repack by strategineer

## Intro

TGGW is one of the best roguelikes out there. Setting it up and making it look good can be a little tough though.

So I've pre-configured a portable version of Cmder with sane defaults to make playing TGGW as pain free as possible.

I recommend using the ProggySmall.ttf font that I've included in this pack because it looks good but feel free to use any font you want (Windows Key + Alt + P will bring up the Cmder options). You might need to play around with the font size if you change the font though.

## Instructions

1. Install ProggySmall.ttf font
2. Run the TGGW.cmd file.
3. Enjoy!

## Errors

If you get an error message from Cmder when you run the TGGW.cmd file, it probably means that the font size is too large preventing TGGW from booting up properly. To fix this, press Windows Key + Alt + P, go to the Font menu, lower the font size, save your settings then close the window and boot it up again to. Repeat this process until the error goes away!

## Licenses

Both Cmder and the Proggy font are licensed using the MIT license.
