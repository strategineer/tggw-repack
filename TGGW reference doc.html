<h1>Reference Document (v2.6)</h1>
<p>This is a reference document for all effects available in v2.6.*. The best way of using it is to search (ctrl+f in most browsers) for the effect you are looking for. In future releases this list will hopefully exist in-game.</p>

<h3>Derived Attributes</h3>
<h5>Thievery</h5>
<p>Thievery is computed by: 5+vision-noise. Being confused induces a penalty of -2. Your effective chance to disarm traps, steal successfully and to use thief weapon is 10*thievery% under normal circumstances. However, this is scaled down when thievery is negative or over 10.</p>
<h5>Avoid Spells</h5>
<p>Your chance to avoid spells is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>5*maxMp%</p>
<p>As &#8220;spell&#8221; counts any monster attack labelled with &#8220;magic&#8221; and which has an Mp-cost. Monsters chance to avoid spells applies to your attacks from wands or rods.</p>
<p>With the following special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unaware of the monster that attacks you (i.e., it makes a surprise attack against you) this value is set to 0%</li>
<li>Values over 90% will be altered. 100% becomes 91%, 110% becomes 92% and so forth. Values under 10% are not altered.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attacks</h2>
<p>There are three types of attacks: melee, missile and magic. Here are the rules for these types of attacks. Both for the player and monsters.</p>
<h4>Melee</h4>
<p>Melee (bump) attacks uses the &#8220;melee&#8221; attribute to determine its chance to hit. If it hits, the victim has &#8220;block&#8221; chance to block it. You can melee monsters even if you can&#8217;t see them, the same applies for monsters.</p>
<h4>Missile</h4>
<p>Missile attacks uses the &#8220;missile&#8221; attribute to determine its chance to hit. If it hits, the victim has &#8220;block&#8221; chance to block it. All missile attacks has a maximum range which can be seen by examining the monster (or the player). All missile attacks also have limited ammo which can also be seen by examining. You have to see a monster in order to make a missile attack against it, and vice versa for a monster.</p>
<h4>Magic</h4>
<p>Magic attacks always hit, but the victim gets &#8220;avoid spells&#8221; chance to completely neglect it. All magic attacks have a maximum range which can be seen when exploring the spell or attack. Most magic attacks consume Mp from the caster. For single target magic attacks you have to see the target to cast it and vice versa for monsters. Area attacks works in an area no matter if the target is seen or not. Magic attacks don&#8217;t work if the caster is &#8220;confused&#8221;.</p>
<h4>Surprise</h4>
<p>Any of the above can be a &#8220;surprise&#8221; attack. A surprise attack negates the possibility to block or avoid the attack. A player is surprised if an attack is made against him while in &#8220;exploring&#8221; mode.</p>
<p>A monster is surprised by an attack if it is made when the monster is &#8220;unaware of you&#8221; (that is, it neither hears nor sees you).</p>

<h3>Perception</h3>
<p>In this section we describe what it means for monsters to see and hear you. Analoguous rules apply for you to see a monster.</p>
<h4>Seeing</h4>
<p>A monster can see you if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are within &#8220;vision&#8221; squares of it and there&#8217;s nothing in the way, or</li>
<li>if you are &#8220;in light&#8221; and nothing is in the way, or</li>
<li>the monster have &#8220;infravision&#8221; and nothing is in the way</li>
</ul>
<p>Being &#8220;invisible&#8221; negates all the above, unless the monster has the effect &#8220;see invisible&#8221;.</p>
<p>If a monster can see you it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>chase you.</li>
<li>make any kind of attack on you (melee, missile, magic), targeted or area.</li>
<li>make Attacks of Opportunity against you.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hearing</h4>
<p>A monster can hear you if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are within your own &#8220;noise&#8221; squares of it and the monster is not in an isloated place (noise travels around corners and through doors etc). If the monster has &#8220;deep sleep&#8221; and is sleeping other rules apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a monster can hear you it:</p>
<ul>
<li>can chase you.</li>
<li>can make a melee attack against you.</li>
<li>wakes up if it was sleeping.</li>
</ul>
